The\ntemperature was raised to 130−200 °C in order to tune the size with\nhigher (lower) temperatures favoring larger (smaller) NCs. Once the\ntemperature stabilized, 1 mL of a Cs-oleate precursor solution (125\nmM in ODE, prepared as described below) was injected.\n\nThe reaction\nwas then immediately quenched with an ice bath.

Restricting\nthe physical dimensions of the CsPbBr3 perovskite crystallites\nto a nanometer region would further unlock spatial conﬁnement eﬀects. This change allows large spectral tunability, thus\nfacilitating the band-gap optimization for the devices.5−10\nPressure, as a unique thermodynamic variable, provides a\npowerful means to study the structural and electronic behaviors\nof MHP materials.",

The Raman spectrum (Figure S4)\nof the as-prepared GO displayed two prominent peaks, the D\nband (1599 cm−1) and G band (1360 cm−1), with a peak height\nratio (ID/IG) of 1.27. After introducing GO, the CsPbBr3 QDs\nwere evenly distributed on the GO sheets (Figure 2b). The size\nand crystallinity of the CsPbBr3 QDs remained identical, as\nconcluded from the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in\nFigure 2c and the statistics in Figure S2b. Moreover, the\nenergy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mappings of Cs, Pb, Br, and C\nfurther conﬁrmed the existence and uniform dispersion of the\nCsPbBr3 QDs on GO.

These rates are superior to those of CdS and other newly\ndeveloped photocatalysts with visible-light responses under Xelamp illumination (Table S1). Notably, the selectivity for CO2\nreduction was impressively greater than 99%, implying the\neﬃcient suppression of the H2 evolution reaction in the\nnonaqueous solvent. However, part of the CO yield potentially\noriginates from the partial photooxidation of ethyl acetate,\nwhich was evidenced via a control experiment using an inert N2\ninstead of a saturated CO2 atmosphere.",

    "gold_evidence_text": "Recently, the halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have\nemerged as strong candidates for photocatalytic applications\nowing to their high extinction coeﬃcients, broad absorption\nranges, and appropriate band positions.27−29 In particular, the\ntypical all-inorganic perovskite material CsPbBr3 has aroused\nthe most intense interest on account of its relatively robust\nstability against humidity and high temperature.30,31 However,\nas in the case of other single-component photocatalysts like\nLDHs, pristine perovskite CsPbBr3 suﬀers from severe\nelectron−hole radiative recombination, which makes it exhibit\nunsatisfactory performance in CO2 photoreduction.32−34 So\nfar, great eﬀorts have been made to construct CsPbBr3-based\nheterojunctions with superior photocatalytic performance,\nincluding the traditional type-II heterojunctions such as\nCsPbBr3/g-C3N4,35 P3HT/CsPbBr3,36 CsPbBr3/UiO-66-\n(NH2),37 and CsPbBr3/MoS2\n38 and Z-scheme heterojunctions\nincluding α-Fe2O3/CsPbBr3\n39 and CsPbBr3/Bi2WO6,40,41 as\nwell as the newly emerged S-scheme heterojunction of TiO2/\nCsPbBr3,42,43 BiVO4/CsPbBr3,44 WO3/CsPbBr3,45 CsPbBr3\n/BiOBr,46 etc.\n\nHowever, the fabrication of the S-scheme\nheterojunction of CsPbBr3/LDHs and its application in\nphotocatalytic CO2 reduction have not been reported. In\nview of the advantages of each component, it is anticipated that\nthe combination of CsPbBr3 and LDHs will yield an eﬃcient\nphotocatalyst for CO2 reduction. In the present work, motivated by the high oxidation\npotential of CoAl-LDH, more negative reduction potential of\nCsPbBr3, and strong visible-light-harvesting capability of both\ncomponents, we constructed a novel CsPbBr3/CoAl-LDH\ncomposite photocatalyst for CO2 reduction. Based on various\ncharacterization techniques such as X-ray photoelectron\nspectra (XPS), Mott−Schottky (M−S) plots, and electron\nspin resonance (ESR), an S-scheme charge transfer mode\nbetween CsPbBr3 and CoAl-LDH was validated.\n\nBeneﬁtting\nfrom the eﬃcient charge separation and retainment of the\nstrongly reductive electrons, the resultant CsPbBr3/CoAl-LDH\ncomposite exhibited remarkable photocatalytic activity toward\nCO2 reduction.

However, the high carrier\nrecombination rate and the low conversion eﬃciency of as-prepared catalysts\ngreatly restrict their photocatalytic application. Herein, we synthesize Ti3C2/\nCsPbBr3 quantum dot (Ti3C2/CsPbBr3 QD) composites by the method of selfassembly, which are used in the photoreduction of CO2. As a result, Ti3C2/\nCsPbBr3 QD composites exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity and stability\nfor the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.",
